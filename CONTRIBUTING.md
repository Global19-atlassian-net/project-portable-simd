# Contributing to Portable SIMD

Welcome to the Portable SIMD project group!

## Where's the source code?

See the [`rust-lang/stdsimd`](https://github.com/rust-lang/stdsimd) repository for the `std::simd` implementation.
All questions, feature requests, bugs, and pull requests related to `std::simd` should be directed to `rust-lang/stdsimd` instead of here.

This repository is for the project group itself and writing supporting materials for `std::simd`.
